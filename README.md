This my internship project. The program allow people connected to the same ethernet network to do both global chat and private chat.Global chat is an environment where all active users can write and read messages in common. Private chat is an environment in which two people can message in an environment that others do not have access to. I develop this application in Qt framework by using TCP, UDP protocols.
